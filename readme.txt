Here’s the revised document, incorporating customization for various file types and a layman’s explanation of the technical workings of the script:

Script Purpose and Documentation

Overview

This script is designed to analyze Git commit history and assess the complexity of changes made by specified authors within a defined date range. It processes various file types, such as JavaScript, Handlebars, CSS, and JSON, to evaluate the complexity of code changes, providing valuable insights into the codebase’s evolution over time.

Key Features:

	•	Complexity Analysis: The script identifies changes in code complexity based on the number of lines modified and the presence of certain programming constructs.
	•	Reporting: It generates a comprehensive CSV report summarizing the complexity analysis for each commit, allowing for easy tracking and review.
	•	Effort Tracking: By analyzing the complexity of changes, the script helps teams understand the effort required for code modifications and improvements.
	•	Easy Querying: Users can specify authors and date ranges to filter the commit history, making it straightforward to focus on relevant contributions.
	•	Custom Filters: The script allows customization of authors, branches, and date ranges, enabling tailored analyses for specific contexts.
	•	Future Customization: The script can be easily adapted to include additional file types and complexity analysis criteria, making it versatile for different projects.

Purpose

1. Complexity Analysis

The primary purpose of this script is to perform a detailed analysis of the complexity of code changes made in a Git repository. This is achieved through:

	•	File Type Differentiation: The script distinguishes between different file types, applying specific rules to evaluate complexity. For instance:
	•	JavaScript (JS): Looks for constructs such as loops, conditional statements, and asynchronous patterns.
	•	Handlebars (HBS): Analyzes nested templates and helper functions.
	•	CSS/SASS: Checks for complex structures like mixins and imports.
	•	JSON: Considers the size of changes as a complexity indicator.

2. Reporting

The script generates a CSV report that captures the following data for each commit:

	•	Author: The email of the author who made the commit.
	•	Commit: The unique identifier of the commit.
	•	Date: The date the commit was made.
	•	File: The files that were changed.
	•	Extension: The type of each file (e.g., JS, HBS).
	•	Complexity Level: An assessment of the complexity of changes (Low, Moderate, High).
	•	Lines Changed: The number of lines added or removed.

This structured report allows teams to review contributions efficiently and track changes over time.

3. Effort Tracking

By assessing the complexity of code changes, teams can better understand the effort required for modifications. High complexity changes may require more review and testing time, while simpler changes can be processed more quickly. This insight helps teams allocate resources and manage workload effectively.

4. Easy Querying

The script simplifies querying commit history by allowing users to specify:

	•	Authors: Focus analysis on specific contributors.
	•	Branches: Analyze commits from specific branches in the repository.
	•	Date Ranges: Restrict analysis to a defined time period, making it easy to understand contributions during specific project phases.

5. Custom Filters

The flexibility of the script enables teams to customize the analysis based on their needs. Users can modify the list of authors, branch names, and date ranges directly in the script. This adaptability ensures that the script remains relevant for different projects and contexts.

6. Future Customization

The script is designed with customization in mind, allowing developers to easily add support for additional file types (e.g., XML, Markdown, or custom file formats) and define new complexity evaluation criteria. This ensures that the script can evolve alongside the project and meet diverse analytical needs.

Technical Working (In Layman’s Terms)

Here’s a brief, simplified explanation of how the script works:

	1.	Setup: The script begins by defining a list of authors, the branch to analyze, and the date range for the commits.
	2.	Collecting Data: It uses Git commands to fetch the commit history for the specified authors and date range. This includes details like what files were changed in each commit.
	3.	Analyzing Complexity: For each changed file, the script checks its type (like JavaScript or JSON) and looks for specific patterns that indicate complexity (like loops or conditionals). It counts how many lines were changed in the file.
	4.	Generating Reports: After analyzing all the commits, the script saves the results in a CSV file, including details such as the author, commit ID, date, file changes, complexity level, and lines modified.
	5.	Customization Options: The script is flexible and can be easily modified in the future to accommodate more file types or different complexity rules, making it useful for various programming projects.

Conclusion

The Git commit analysis script serves as a valuable tool for software development teams aiming to track code complexity, evaluate author contributions, and manage efforts efficiently. By automating complexity assessment and generating comprehensive reports, the script facilitates better decision-making and resource allocation in software projects.
